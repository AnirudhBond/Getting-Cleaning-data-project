The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course project.

Download the dataset
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset. Please find below the link for dataset-

Assign each data to variables
-features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.
-activity <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)
-subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column
contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
-x_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features test data
-y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
contains test data of activities’code labels
-subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
-x_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
contains recorded features train data
-y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns
contains train data of activities’code labels

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
Merged_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
extract (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting Merged_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Entire numbers in code column of the extract replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable. Thus created dataset is stored in extract_activity


4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
-All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
-All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
-All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
-All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
-All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
-All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time
Thus created dataset is stored in tidy_dataset

5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
tidydata_mean (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing tidy_datset taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouped by subject and activity.
Export tidaydata_mean into tidydata_mean.txt file.
